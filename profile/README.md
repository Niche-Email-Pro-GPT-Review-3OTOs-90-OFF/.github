# There was a time when I genuinely believed email marketing was a waste of time.

I had read the stats, seen the success stories, and even watched case studies of brands making thousands of dollars through email campaigns. But when I tried it for myself, the results were disappointing.

I spent hours writing emails. I carefully chose my words, crafted subject lines that I thought were attention-grabbing, and followed the so-called “best practices.”

And then… nothing happened.

- Low open rates.
- Zero conversions.
- No engagement.

I started wondering: **What am I doing wrong?**

The real problem wasn’t that email marketing didn’t work. It was that I was wasting too much time on the wrong things. And that is when I found **Niche Email Pro GPT**—a tool that changed everything.

## The Harsh Truth About Why Most Email Campaigns Fail

Most people who fail at email marketing make the same three mistakes:

1. **They don’t understand their audience** – If you send generic emails, people will ignore them. Readers want relevance and value—not another “limited-time offer” they’ve seen a thousand times.
2. **They spend too much time writing instead of strategizing** – A good email is important, but spending hours writing each one is inefficient. Email marketing is a numbers game—you need a system that allows you to send emails consistently.
3. **They fail to optimize for conversions** – Writing a good email is one thing. Writing an email that gets opens, clicks, and sales is another.

I had fallen into all three of these traps. I was writing too much, too slowly, and with no clear strategy.

I needed something that could speed up my workflow, eliminate the guesswork, and create high-converting emails on demand. That’s when I discovered **Niche Email Pro GPT**.
